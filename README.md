# Fruit-Classification-using-KNN
### Description
In this project, we employed the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify fruits based on a given dataset. The dataset consists of various attributes such as fruit name, subtype, mass, width, height, and color score. By training the model on this dataset, we were able to predict the fruit label of new, unseen fruits accurately.
